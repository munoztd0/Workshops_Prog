## Workshops

The main goal of these workshop series is to create the oppurtunity for Neuroscience/Pscyhology master students to improve their skills in data wrangling through active problem solving (with hints and guidelines) that are representative of ‘real world’ problems that one will probably encounter in cogntive/affective neuroscience research.

A non exaustive list of skills/methods we are going to focus on:

- Code reproducibility (dynamic programming)
- Code understandability (comments, style, Rmarkdown, Jupyter notebook)
- Version control and code availability (github)
- Terminal familiarity
- Automatisation (creating functions)
- Data wrangling and 
- Data Vizualisation

*Advanced Data Visualization with R and Ggplot2*.

*What*: The grammar of graphics is a way of thinking about how graphs are constructed that allows data analysts to move beyond thinking about a small number of graph types (like bar graphs, line graphs, scatter plots, etc).

*Why*: The scientific literature is riddled with bad charts and graphs, leading to misunderstanding and worse... Avoiding design missteps can improve understanding of research. When it comes to practical usage, data visualization is as important as any other part of science could be, especially when it comes to practical use.

This practical will teach you the major components of the *Grammar of Graphics*:
- *Aesthetics*: Identify the dimensions you want to visualize, confirm the axes based on the data dimensions, positions of various data points in the plot. 
- *Scale*: Do we need to scale the potential values, use a specific scale to represent multiple values or a range?
- *Geoms*: Should it be points, bars, lines and so on?
- *Statistics*: Do we need to show some statistical measures in the visualization like measures of central tendency, spread, confidence intervals?
- *Facets*: Do we need to create subplots based on specific data dimensions?

We will use different real world example to apply these concepts, adn learn which appropriate visualizations to represent your data.
- *Correlation*: scatterplot and bubble plot
- *Distribution*: histogram, density and boxplot.
- *Ranking*: barplot, lollipop and treemap.
- *Evolution*: line plot and area chart.

*Data wrangling with R*

*What*: Data wrangling is the process of converting and mapping raw data and getting it ready for analysis. 

*Why*: With the world of data rapidly expanding, it is becoming increasingly essential to get the right data to be organized for analysis. Hence, it is important to make raw data usable for stastitical methos.


Learning Objectives:

- Select columns in a data frame with the dplyr function *select*.
- Select rows in a data frame according to filtering conditions with the dplyr function *filter*.
- Direct the output of one dplyr function to the input of another function with the *‘pipe’ operator %>%*.
- Add new columns to a data frame that are functions of existing columns with *mutate*.
- Understand the *split-apply-combine* concept for data analysis.
- Use *summarize*, *group_by*, and *count* to split a data frame into groups of observations, apply a summary statistics for each group, and then combine the results.
- *Joining* tables by a common variable.
- Learning how to pivot from wide to long data (and the other way around) with *pivot_longer* and *pivot_wider*.

*ANOVAs in R: A complete guide*

*What*: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is a family of statistical tests that are useful when comparing several sets of scores. A common application of ANOVA is to test if the means of three or more groups are equal. The basic idea behind ANOVA is a comparison of the variance between the groups and the variance within the groups.

*Why*: A key statistical test in research fields including biology, economics and psychology, is the analysis of variance (ANOVA). However thez are not taught in most Bachelor curriculum (and is not even taught in the Master of Neuroscience).

Learning Objectives:

- Linear regression reminder
- The different ANOVA tests (One-way, Two-way, Repeated Measures)
- Interactions between variables and covariates
- Finding the best-fit model 
- Checking your assumptions
- Post-hoc test
- Plot results 
- Report the results

## R Lunches 

The idea behind this lunches is to make available all the ressources we have gathered/created over the years make other people’s life easier.

Another purpose is to create a network of people interested in Data Science and a place for them to find information about it, so really feel free to ask for new stuff and comment on what is not working for you.

Moreover, if you are interested in the project don’t hesitate to participate !
